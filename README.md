- Disable Injection
```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection-
```
- Enable Injection
```
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

- Add the loyalty services
```
kubectl apply -f services/loyalty-app/loyalty.yaml
kubectl apply -f services/loyalty-app/loyalty-ingress.yaml
```
- Add the offers services
```
kubectl apply -f services/offers-app/offers.yaml
kubectl apply -f services/offers-app/offers-ingress.yaml
```

- Envoy Adapter
kubectl apply -f samples/apigee-envoy-adapter.yaml
kubectl get pods -n apigee

- Add Product Mapping

These steps needs to be used if you have have also installed apigee-crd in your cluster. To know how to setup apigee-cd you camn refer here:
https://github.com/rajeshm7910/apigee-crd

```
kubectl apply -f apigee/apigee_loyalty_product.yaml
kubectl apply -f apigee/apigee_loyalty_developer.yaml
kubectl apply -f apigee/apigee_loyalty_developerapp.yaml
kubectl get developerapps

##### Pre Demo Script #################
kubectl delete -f samples/envoyfilter-sidecar.yaml

##### Demo Starts Here #################

There are two microservices - loyalty service and offers service. Loyalty services returns all the members and offers service provides all the differnt offers.

These services are built as containers and deployed in kubernetes clusters.
```
kubectl get svc
kubectl get pods
```

These services are deployed in istio service meshes and a envoy sidecar is running. In order to access these services we have istio ingressgateway and defined Gateway and VirtualSevices to access.

```
kubectl get gateway
```

The details of these Gateway and Virtual Services can be be found at 
```
cat services/loyalty-app/loyalty-ingress.yaml
cat services/offers-app/offers-ingress.yaml
```

These services can also be tested as 

```
curl https://api.loyalty.dynolab.app/members
curl https://api.offers.dynolab.app/offers
```

These services can be accessed without any security. Apigee Envoy Adapter lets you secure this service by adding Envoy filter to the envoy sidecar proxy.  Lets apply the Adapter.
```
kubectl apply -f samples/envoyfilter-sidecar.yaml
```

Lets take a moment to review whats inside the filter
```
cat samples/envoyfilter-sidecar.yaml
```

HTTP Filter
This enables Envoyâ€™s Http External Auth filter for all inbound HTTP calls arriving at all services pod managed by apigee.  The Http External Auth filter calls out to an external service apigee-remote-service-envoy.apigee:5000.

Network Filter
It also enables the Envoy's Access Log filter for all network calls which is required for Analytics.

Once this is applied try the curl command 

```
curl -i https://api.loyalty.dynolab.app/members  
should return 403
```

```
curl -i https://api.offers.dynolab.app/offers  
should return 403
```

- Go to Apigee UI 
     Talk about Api Product - Retail API Loyalty Product
     Talk about App -   Retail API Loyalty App
     Get the API Key - 

- Go to Dev portal , use the API Key to access the APIs -
    - Loyalty API and then Offers API.  Offers API will show 403

-  Test Qouta 
Go to CLI for repeated access - 

Repeat 5 - 10 times :
curl -i https://api.loyalty.dynolab.app/members?x-api-key=xPrbt67D1ydoZdBGdToRkURd6su649CwPrbMfrBeuYocDPI2
